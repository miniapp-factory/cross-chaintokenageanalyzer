App Name: Cross-Chain Token Age Analyzer

Description:
Cross-Chain Token Age Analyzer is a Mini App that tracks how long tokens remain idle across different blockchain networks. Monitor dormant token age, wallet holding patterns, and sudden movements after long inactivity. Receive alerts when previously inactive tokens begin moving, potentially signaling market shifts.

Key Features:
 • Real-time tracking of token age across multiple chains
 • Alerts for sudden movements of long-dormant tokens
 • Wallet-level holding duration analysis
 • Historical charts of token activity and inactivity periods
 • Dashboard to follow selected tokens and wallets

Use Case:
Ideal for traders, analysts, and on-chain researchers who want to identify accumulation patterns, detect reactivated wallets, and anticipate potential market moves based on token inactivity cycles.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` values to match the new app description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this file to generate the app logo.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. The logo file can be created directly.

A stylized token icon with a clock overlay, representing token age tracking across multiple blockchain networks. The token is a circular coin with a subtle gradient from deep blue to teal, and a translucent clock face centered on it. The clock hands point to a 12:00 position, symbolizing the start of tracking. The background is a light gray gradient that gives depth, and the overall composition conveys real‑time monitoring and analytics of token inactivity.
